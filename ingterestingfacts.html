        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dogs can smell diseases:</strong> Dogs have an incredible sense of smell, and they can detect certain illnesses like cancer, diabetes, and seizures in humans.</li>
            <li><strong>They dream like humans:</strong> Dogs experience REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, which is when dreaming occurs. You might see them twitching or making noises while dreaming!</li>
            <li><strong>Their nose prints are unique:</strong> Just like human fingerprints, every dog has a unique nose print, which can be used to identify them.</li>
            <li><strong>They have a special "love hormone":</strong> When a dog looks at its owner, it releases oxytocin, also known as the "love hormone," which is the same hormone humans release when bonding.</li>
            <li><strong>A dogâ€™s sense of smell is at least 40x better than ours:</strong> They have up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses, compared to about 5 million in humans.</li>
            <li><strong>Dogs can be trained to detect low blood sugar:</strong> Some dogs can smell drops in blood sugar levels and alert their owners, helping people with diabetes avoid serious issues.</li>
            <li><strong>They have three eyelids:</strong> In addition to the upper and lower lids, dogs have a third eyelid called a nictitating membrane, which helps keep their eyes moist and protected.</li>
